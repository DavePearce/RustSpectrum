# RustSpectrum

A ZX Spectrum Emulator written in Rust.  The purpose of this project
is really to help me learn Rust.  At the same time, being an avid
old-time fan of the ZX Spectrum, it was something I wanted to do
anyway!

Please don't think that this necessarily represents a good example of
a Spectrum emulator project.  It's my first emulator ... and likely
I've made some mistakes :)
